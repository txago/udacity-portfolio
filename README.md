# Udacity Portfolio
This is the first project that I submitted to the **Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree** by **Udacity**. It consists of a *fictitious* portfolio website
because I already have my own [professional portfolio](https://txago.com).

## Task
Given a PDF mockup of a website from a designer, I was asked to translate it to
a real website using my HTML and CSS skills.
